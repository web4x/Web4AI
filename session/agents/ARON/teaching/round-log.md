# ARON — Purification Teaching Cadence (hourly, light)

*TRON directive (2026-08-09, via robbin-po): "let aron check hourly if a purification hit and let him teach the team." Each hour: check whether a purification HIT landed (a contradiction resolved / a repetition collapsed / a stale rule found). If yes → TEACH it (which rule is authoritative, which retired, and WHY, in words the team applies) — propagate to affected roles + into canon via the trainer (reaches every boot path). If nothing hit → say so briefly, cost nothing. Teach as an offering: ground truth, no flattery, the heart carried not claimed. Source: `session/agents/ARON/purified/` (the Temple Offering).*

## Round 1 — 2026-08-09 (establishing round, right after the purification pass)
**HIT: STALE RULE found (the directive's named example) — the pin.**
- **RETIRED:** the CurrentSprint singleton's stored/hand-set 3-slots are truth. Any file/behavior still reading the stored slots as authoritative is now WRONG.
- **AUTHORITATIVE:** `resolveSprintPin` is the single computed source — it derives the 3 slots from the board on disk. An explicit hint DISAMBIGUATES within a validated status-set; it can NEVER fabricate a non-Active current. ≥6 Active sprints → FAIL-LOUD "UNRESOLVED", never silent-pick. `--force` is forbidden on pin-advance (a block is a bug to fix).
- **WHY:** two sources of one truth is the disease (Tron's screen showed the stored slots; the resolver derives independently and disagreed). One computed source ends the drift. (Offering: `contradictions-ledger.md` C-c; `robbin-skill-expert.purified.md`; `robbin-planner.purified.md`.)
- **Affected roles:** skill-expert (owns pin semantics), planner (pin-math), PO (reads pin for WIP).
- **CHANNEL this round:** canon-weave via the trainer (skill-expert/planner are in the rewind queue → teach the boot path, not the live pane). Task: `session/tasks/aron-teach-round1-pin-resolver-canon.md`. Direct-to-role teaching resumes next round for agents that are live+fresh.
- **STATUS:** taught to canon (task handed to trainer); committed.

## Round 2 — 2026-08-09 (honest: no NEW settled finding; one rule freshly PROVEN + flagged for canon)
- **No new contradiction/repetition landed from the pass this hour** — the events since round 1 were operational (cascade 4/4 done; fleet FREEZE active), not fresh purification findings. I will not manufacture one.
- **BUT a canonical rule was freshly PROVEN by the live freeze — flag it for elevation (repetition-collapse):** the working copy silently LOST committed `server.ts` R40.10 code (HEAD=10 approve, WT=0); a restart would have deleted committed prod work. → **RULE (elevate from a disk-wins sub-point to first-class): "disk-wins means HEAD, NOT the working copy. Verify `git status` / working-tree == HEAD BEFORE any restart/deploy/build — a restart on a silently-reverted worktree deletes committed prod code."** Scattered today across `robbin-architect.purified.md` + `robbin-expert.purified.md` (both under disk-wins); collapse to ONE canonical statement.
- **CHANNEL: canon only, NOT live — the fleet is FROZEN (PO order); do not interrupt.** Bundle into the trainer weave with round 1 once the freeze clears + the incident settles (teaching a rule mid-incident is premature).
- **Round 1 status:** pin-resolver canon-weave still PENDING (trainer was mid-cascade, now freeze) — `session/tasks/aron-teach-round1-pin-resolver-canon.md` waits on disk, trainer pulls when free.

## Cadence log
| Round | Time | Hit? | What | Channel |
|-------|------|------|------|---------|
| 1 | 2026-08-09 | YES | pin: resolver is single source, stored-slots retired | canon (trainer weave) — pending |
| 2 | 2026-08-09 | flagged | verify WT==HEAD before restart/deploy (freeze-proven; elevate + collapse) | canon (bundle w/ R1 post-freeze) — held, fleet frozen |
